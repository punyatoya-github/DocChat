### **‚ú® Getting started**

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork:  
   * git clone https://github.com/your-username/docchat.git  
   * cd docchat  
2. Create a feature branch:  
   * git checkout \-b feat/my-feature  
3. Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment and install dependencies:  
   * python3.11 \-m venv venv  
   * source venv/bin/activate  
   * pip install \-r requirements.txt  
4. Copy .env.example ‚Üí .env and fill in required credentials (never commit .env)

### **üß≠ How to contribute**

* Bug reports: Open an Issue with a clear title, a concise description, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.  
* Feature requests: Open an Issue describing the use case, expected behavior, and possible implementation notes.  
* Code contributions: Submit a Pull Request (PR) from your forked branch that targets the main repository‚Äôs development or release branch (e.g., 2-final). Keep PRs small and focused.

---

### **üß© Branching & workflow**

* Create branches using the pattern:  
  * feat/\<short-description\>  
  * fix/\<short-description\>  
  * docs/\<short-description\>  
* Rebase or merge the latest upstream changes before opening a PR.  
* Each PR must include a clear description of what it changes and why.

---

### **‚úÖ PR checklist**

Before requesting a review, ensure:

* Code follows existing style and patterns (read existing modules for guidance).  
* New functionality includes tests where appropriate.  
* All tests pass locally.  
* Static checks (linters, formatting) are run. Use black/isort/flake8 if configured.  
* Documentation updated (README, docs, or code comments) for user-facing changes.  
* No secrets or credentials were committed.

Suggested PR description sections:

* Summary: one-paragraph overview of the change  
* Motivation: why the change is needed  
* Implementation: key files changed and high-level approach  
* Tests: how this was tested locally  
* Backwards compatibility notes (if any)

---

### **üß™ Testing**

* Add unit/integration tests under a tests/ directory where applicable.  
* Use pytest for running tests:  
  * pytest tests/  
* Include small sample inputs/fixtures where useful.  
* For model or large-file dependent tests, use mocks or short fixtures; avoid committing large binaries.

---

### **üìö Style and documentation**

* Follow existing code structure and modularization.  
* Write clear docstrings for public functions and classes.  
* Update README.md, examples, or docs for any user-visible change.  
* Provide usage examples for new features.

---

### 

### **üîê Security & secrets**

* Never commit credentials, API keys, or large datasets. Use .env and add it to .gitignore.  
* If you accidentally commit secrets, remove them and rotate the credentials immediately.

---

### **üêõ Reporting issues**

When filing an issue, include:

* A descriptive title and short summary  
* Steps to reproduce  
* Expected vs actual behavior  
* Environment (OS, Python version, package versions)  
* Attach logs, stack traces, or small sample files if helpful

---

### **üë• Code of Conduct**

Be respectful and professional. Contributions come from many people with different backgrounds and experience levels. Treat others with kindness and constructive feedback.

---

### **üì¨ Communication & support**

* Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.  
* Open a PR for code changes. Tag maintainers in PRs if you need a quick review.  
* If you need mentoring or help splitting a large task, open an Issue labeled "help-wanted".

---

### **üì¶ Release & packaging**

* Keep changes small per PR and reference the target release branch.  
* Document breaking changes clearly in PRs.  
* Tag maintainers for release approvals.
